# Restaurant-Data-Analysis
This project aims to analyze a dataset containing restaurant information. The analysis focuses on various aspects such as the distribution of ratings, the relationship between votes and ratings, the availability of online delivery and table booking across different price ranges, and identifying common positive and negative keywords in text reviews.

### Task 2: Price Range vs. Online Delivery and Table Booking

- *Objective:* Analyze if there is a relationship between the price range and the availability of online delivery and table booking. Determine if higher-priced restaurants are more likely to offer these services.

## Conclusion

This project analyzed various dimensions of the restaurant industry dataset, including cuisine popularity, city-wise distribution and ratings, price ranges, online delivery trends, cuisine combinations, geographic patterns, restaurant chains, reviews sentiment, and customer engagement through votes analysis. The insights gained provide valuable understanding of industry trends, customer preferences, and operational strategies for restaurant stakeholders.
